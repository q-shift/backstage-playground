# @qshift/quarkus-plugins

This project contains different [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) plugins to work with [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) which is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, crafted from best-of-breed Java libraries and standards.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (18 or 20)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), npm and [yarn 4.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) installed

## Getting started

To play with one of our plugins, create first a [Backstage](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/) application locally using this command:
```
npx @backstage/create-app@latest
```

Next, verify if the newly application created is working fine: `yarn dev`

If this is the case, you can start to play with one or all our plugins :-)
